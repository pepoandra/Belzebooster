Digital guitar pedal with several effects written in **C** for the DSPIC30XX micro-controller family.

For this project, the team designed both the hardware and the software to build a **guitar pedal** with digital effects and **true by-pass**. 
  As shown below, the system consists of an antialiasing filter to ensure best sampling, an **A/D converter** which is integrated in the micro-controller, the **DSPIC3040** and an **D/A converter**.
